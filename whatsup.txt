The object of this program is to demonstrate how to use the LS_OWNERDRAW 
listbox feature and to utilize that feature to highlite a keyword in any 
listbox item which is needed.

I have found there are a lot of functions that do not have good 
documentation in both the IBM and Microsoft toolkits that it sometimes 
becomes frustrating trying to figure out how to use them.

When I looked in my Microsoft OS/2 Programmer's Reference Manual trying 
to figure out how to accomplish an OWNERDRAW listbox, it was about as 
clear as mud (refer to page 186 - 187, Volume 1).

After receiving some help from Guy Scharf (CIS ID: 76702,557) I was able 
to complete this function. After getting his information, the 
information in the manual actually did make a lot more sense.

If you are in need of creating your own style listboxes this will at 
least put you in the right direction.

If you want to contact me, feel free to call my BBS or send me mail on 
CIS (I usually check my BBS a *lot* more frequently than I do CIS).
